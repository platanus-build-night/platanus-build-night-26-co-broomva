/**
 * THE EFFORT-VOCABULARY TEST.
 *
 * `effort` is the key `rankBindings` sorts by, and "cheapest fix first" is the
 * entire point of that ordering. It is also an enum, and an enum is only usable
 * by an agent that can discover its legal values. This file is the executed
 * proof that it can.
 *
 * The bug this was written against: the values lived in exactly one place —
 * a type declaration in `schemas/route.ts` — and appeared neither in the
 * `--dispatch` payload the agent is told to judge from nor in `SKILL.md`. An
 * agent followed the documented three-step shape, authored `"effort": "low"`,
 * and the field was warned about and dropped. Correct fail-safe behaviour, and
 * a silently unranked result: the drop is loud on stderr and invisible in the
 * artifact.
 *
 * Every test here EXECUTES the real CLI — `bun route.ts --dispatch` and
 * `bun route.ts --proposals` as separate processes, over the real fixture
 * report. Nothing asserts a constant. In particular there is deliberately no
 * assertion that the enum equals `['config','wiring','process']`: that would
 * assert a constant against itself, which is `self_referential` by this repo's
 * own rubric and would be worthless as evidence for the claim being made.
 *
 * The claim being made is a RELATION between two runtime-derived lists:
 *
 *   the values the dispatch ADVERTISES  ===  the values the validator ACCEPTS
 *
 * Both sides are read out of the running program — the first from the emitted
 * dispatch JSON, the second parsed back out of the validator's own rejection
 * message. The test fails the moment those two drift apart, which is exactly
 * the bug class above, and it would have caught the original finding.
