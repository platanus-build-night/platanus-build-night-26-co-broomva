/**
 * THE ε-AUDIT REPORTING TEST.
 *
 * `SKILL.md` §4 says the probe library's agreement rate is Keel's own
 * counter-metric and that a system refusing to measure its own groundedness is
 * telling you something. The number was computed, carried through the schema
 * (`Verdict.audit`), preserved by `corpus.ts` — and then dropped by the one
 * artifact a human actually reads. This file is the executed proof that it is
 * not dropped any more.
 *
 * EVERY assertion here runs the real `render()` over a real `Report` and reads
 * the bytes that come back. Nothing asserts that a template file contains a
 * substring: a template is an input, and a test that checks its inputs is
 * `self_referential` by this repo's own definition — it would keep passing
 * while `render.ts` stopped filling the block. The renderer is the system under
 * test, so the renderer is what gets executed.
 *
 * The reports are synthetic because they must be: no committed report carries
 * an `audit` block (that is the bug), and the three states that matter —
 * mixed, none, total disagreement — cannot all be sampled from one real run
 * anyway.
