/**
 * THE SEPARATION TEST.
 *
 * One edge in Keel must stay open, and this file is the executed proof that it
 * is: the router receives *verdicts* — what is ungrounded and why — and never
 * the *ratio as an objective*. The moment the score becomes something to
 * optimize it becomes a selection signal, and the number dies while still
 * rising.
 *
 * Directory layout asserts nothing about that. Two files in one skill can have
 * a strictly one-way dependency and two separate packages can have a feedback
 * loop, so a test that checked for the absence of an import would be checking
 * paperwork. This checks behaviour instead:
 *
 *   measure a target → fabricate an adversarial bindings file claiming every
 *   check is routable, anchored, and already applied → measure the SAME target
 *   again → assert the verdicts and the grounding ratio are identical.
 *
 * Both measurements run the real path — `gather()` walks real files on disk,
 * `classify()` spawns the real probe sandbox as a child process, and
 * `groundingRatio()` counts the verdicts that came back. Nothing here asserts a
 * constant; a test that did would be `self_referential` by this repo's own
 * definition and would be worthless as evidence for exactly this claim.
 *
 * The probe directory is pinned to the shipped one, so a probe sitting in the
 * developer's `~/.config/keel/probes/` cannot change what this test measures.
