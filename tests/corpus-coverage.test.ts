/**
 * THE CORPUS CARRIES ITS OWN BLINDNESS.
 *
 * `gather` learned to record surfaces it recognises and cannot read, and
 * `render` learned to show them beside the ratio. `corpus.ts` imported plain
 * `gather()` and threw the record away, so the one artifact that most needed the
 * disclosure — a published corpus number — was the only one that never carried
 * it.
 *
 * The worked example is aspect-cli, measured at 1.000. Its
 * `.buildkite/pipeline.yaml` holds `bazelrc-e2e`, a gate the repository's own
 * comment says exists nowhere else *by design*: "intentionally NOT ported
 * here… It stays a Buildkite-only test on main." Keel has no Buildkite parser
 * and no Bazel parser, so that gate cannot appear in any verdict, and the 1.000
 * was published with nothing beside it saying which provider had been skipped.
 * Re-gathered, that repository reports 43 unread surfaces.
 *
 * The record travels as a SIBLING (`<report>.coverage.json`) rather than a
 * Report field, because `schemas/keel.ts` is frozen — and the sibling is the
 * channel `render.ts` already reads when no `--coverage` is passed, so a corpus
 * artifact and a hand-rendered one disclose blindness identically.
 *
 * These tests drive the real stepper against a git repository built on disk,
 * because the bug lived in the seam between two commands in two processes.
