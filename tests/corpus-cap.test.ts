/**
 * THE DECLARED-VS-EFFECTIVE CAP TEST.
 *
 * `corpus.ts`'s header promises "NO SILENT ANYTHING. The node cap is
 * disclosed". The published summary broke that promise in the quietest way
 * available: it recorded `nodeCap: 40` — the value corpus.json *declares* —
 * above fifteen entries that had each sampled under a `--cap 25`. `next`
 * computed the effective cap correctly and then `record` and `status` reached
 * past it for the declared one. Nothing crashed, nothing warned, and the only
 * machine-readable statement of how the corpus was produced disagreed with the
 * measurements underneath it.
 *
 * The first repair took the cap from the INVOCATION, and that is the bug this
 * file now spends most of its length on. An invocation is not a measurement: a
 * bare `bun corpus.ts next` over a finished corpus clones nothing, samples
 * nothing and binds no node — and then stamped its declared 40 straight back
 * over the same entries. The cap in force is a fact about what was WRITTEN, so
 * it is recovered from the entries: `entry.cap` when present, and otherwise
 * from truncation, because the sampler stops at exactly the cap and a
 * `capped: true` entry's `nodesSampled` therefore IS the cap it was drawn
 * under. That second clause is what reaches the entries written before
 * `entry.cap` existed — the ones a stale header contradicts.
 *
 * The committed distribution those legacy entries actually have, and which the
 * fixture below reproduces literally, is
 *   nodesSampled { 25: 12, 12: 1, 21: 1, 0: 1 }
 * — twelve targets truncated at 25, tiktoken complete at 12 of 12, commander-js
 * complete at 21 of 21, and anthropic-courses with nothing gathered at all.
 * Only the twelve truncated ones prove a cap; the other three prove that the
 * cap was at least as large as their surface, which is not a value, and they
 * are disclosed as indeterminate rather than guessed at.
 *
 * Two kinds of test live here. The first three DRIVE THE REAL STEPPER end to
 * end — clone, gather, sample, judge, record — against a git repository built
 * on disk, then read the bytes corpus.ts wrote; the bug lived in the seam
 * between two commands run in two separate processes, and only running both
 * processes crosses that seam. The rest SEED a summary in the exact shape of
 * the committed one and then run a real command over it, because the
 * regression is specifically about what a later command does to entries it did
 * not write.
 *
 * The fixture repo is built in a temp dir rather than committed, for the reason
 * `tests/helpers/tree.ts` gives: `gather` walks whatever it is pointed at, and a
 * committed tree of fake workflows would enlarge the surface Keel publishes a
 * number about.
