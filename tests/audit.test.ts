/**
 * THE ε-AUDIT TEST.
 *
 * `audit.ts` exists to answer one question about Keel itself: does the probe
 * library still mean what it meant when each probe was reviewed? The answer is
 * only worth something if the re-decision was made without sight of the cached
 * one — so blindness is the property under test here, and it is tested the only
 * way a blindness claim can be: on the serialized bytes the judging agent is
 * handed. A comment saying "we do not include the class" is not evidence.
 *
 * Six things are asserted, all by execution:
 *
 *   BLIND, AND NOT MERELY EMPTY. The pending file contains no class name, no
 *   probeId, no confidence and no write-boundary argument, and neither does the
 *   node section of the printed payload. Each assertion is paired with its
 *   non-vacuous twin — the same strings ARE in the report — because "substring
 *   absent" is trivially true of a payload that is empty or of a fixture that
 *   never had them. The other half of that pairing is the harder one: the
 *   payload must still carry the LITERAL SNIPPET, and every such assertion reads
 *   its expected value out of the REPORT's node, never out of the payload node
 *   being checked. A payload asserted to contain its own fields is a tautology,
 *   and it is satisfied by one that starves the judging agent or that hands over
 *   the wrong node's text under the right node's id — which is why every fixture
 *   node's `raw`, `source` and `hints` are distinct.
 *
 *   HONEST ABOUT ITS OWN COVERAGE. The disclosed percentage is `compared /
 *   population` — the size of the evidence, not the size of the draw. Computing
 *   it over `sampled` would let a run that printed forty nodes and got two back
 *   claim it covered the forty, which is rate-padding one level up from the rate
 *   this script exists to report honestly.
 *
 *   ALL-OR-NOTHING ON BAD INPUT. A rejected batch writes nothing. Every fixture
 *   that asserts this is MIXED — one entry that a partial apply WOULD record,
 *   beside the one that must sink the batch — because "the bytes did not change"
 *   is not a claim when there was nothing valid to write.
 *
 *   DETERMINISTIC. The same seed draws the same nodes, in this process, in a
 *   fresh process, and after the report's verdicts have been shuffled. A sample
 *   nobody can re-derive makes the audit unreviewable: a reader cannot tell a
 *   draw from a choice.
 *
 *   ARITHMETIC, NOT ASSERTION. `agreed` is computed by comparing the two
 *   classes, so a re-decision that CLAIMS agreement while naming a different
 *   class is recorded as a disagreement. And `render.ts` — a module with no
 *   knowledge of this one — is used as the independent reader of every block
 *   this file writes: `auditIsWellFormed` rejects exactly the self-contradictory
 *   shapes, so its acceptance is a signal `audit.ts` cannot produce by agreeing
 *   with itself.
 *
 *   NON-DESTRUCTIVE. No verdict's class moves and the grounding ratio is
 *   byte-identical afterwards. An audit that edited the measurement it audits
 *   would be the failure this project is named for.
 *
 * Nothing below asserts a constant. Every number comes back from running the
 * real functions or spawning the real CLI over files on disk — a test that
 * asserted a literal would be `self_referential` by this repo's own definition.
