/**
 * Pre-flight smoke test — ORCHESTRATOR-OWNED (see 00-orchestration.md).
 *
 * Exists for two reasons:
 *   1. `bun test` must exit 0 before fan-out, or every dispatched unit reads a
 *      pre-existing failure as damage it caused and burns iterations on it.
 *   2. `groundingRatio` is the headline number. The three properties below are
 *      the ones whose breakage would silently INFLATE it, which is the only
 *      direction that matters for a tool arguing about honest measurement.
 *
 * W1-E owns `tests/**` generally and should build on this file, not replace it.
