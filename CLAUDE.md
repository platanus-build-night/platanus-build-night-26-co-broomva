# keel — bstack-governed workspace

## Identity

**Keel measures whether a codebase's verification actually touches the world, or
whether it is only checking itself.** One sentence carries the product:

> A check is only a check if the signal it reads comes from somewhere the thing
> being checked cannot write to.

Every verification edge in a target — CI steps, test targets, review gates,
deploy conditions, integration signals — is classified `anchored` /
`self_referential` / `unknown` / `not_a_check`, yielding a **grounding ratio**
of `anchored / (anchored + self_referential + unknown)`. Novel shapes are judged
agentically; recurring shapes crystallize into **probes** (small reviewable
scripts) so cost per node falls as the library grows. Keel audits its own probe
library and reports the agreement rate as a counter-metric.

Ships as an open agent skill (`npx skills add broomva/keel`) — it runs inside an
existing harness rather than reimplementing one.

Background, research chain, and rejected alternatives:
[`docs/handoffs/2026-07-24-keel-build-night.md`](docs/handoffs/2026-07-24-keel-build-night.md).
Parallelization contract: [`docs/plans/00-orchestration.md`](docs/plans/00-orchestration.md).

This workspace is governed by **bstack** — twenty irreducible primitives (P1–P20) that turn an agent-driven workspace into a self-operating system. The full primitive contract lives in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md). Run `bstack doctor` to verify compliance.

## Project invariants (binding, and stronger than convenience)

**The schema is frozen.** No agent modifies `skills/keel/schemas/keel.ts`. It is
the contract between the engine and every consumer, and a mid-fan-out change
silently invalidates every parallel unit's work. If you believe the schema is
wrong: **stop and report.** The orchestrator decides, re-freezes, and
re-dispatches. Same rule, softer, for `SKILL.md`, `README.md`, and
`site/index.html` — orchestrator-owned; units propose edits in the PR body.

**`skills/keel/` is the packaging boundary.** It is the *only* directory that
ships to users. `skills.sh` excludes just `metadata.json`, `.git`, `__pycache__`,
and `__pypackages__` — so anything else at repo root (`README`, `LICENSE`,
`.github/`, `site/`, `reports/`, `node_modules/`, and now `CLAUDE.md`,
`AGENTS.md`, `.control/`, `scripts/`) would ship into every user's skill store
if the skill were rooted here. Governance lives at root deliberately, and stays
out of the shipped artifact.

**Judgment is the agent's; scripts are plumbing.** Scripts locate, load, cache,
render, and sandbox. They do not classify. An agent that finds itself writing a
lookup table mapping check-name → class has misread the thesis and must stop —
that table is precisely the ungrounded artifact Keel exists to detect.

**`unknown` fails closed.** It counts against the ratio exactly like
`self_referential`. Any code path that defaults a node to `anchored` is a bug,
not a convenience. `not_a_check` is excluded from the ratio and is therefore the
one **shoppable** class: mis-filing a real check there shrinks the denominator
and inflates the score, so it carries the same burden of argument as any other
verdict. Reaching for it because a node is *hard* is wrong; the honest answer
there is `unknown`.

**Probes abstain, never assert ignorance.** `Probe.assess()` returns `null` to
abstain and may never return `unknown` — `unknown` is a claim about the world
and only the agent makes it. This is what keeps the class unshoppable: a lazy
probe degrades to *ask*, never to *looks fine*.

**Toolchain**: Bun + TypeScript + Biome. No npm/yarn, no ESLint/Prettier. Zero
runtime dependencies unless a plan names one — `gather.ts` parses YAML-ish text
without a YAML library on purpose, because carrying the literal snippet forward
beats half-understanding it.

**Keel's own CI is a verification edge Keel will classify.** Write checks that
would score `anchored` — executed assertions, not assertions about assertions. A
test that asserts a constant is `self_referential` by this repo's own definition.
Publishing a poor grounding ratio for ourselves is a bad look at a pitch about
grounding ratios, and fixing it by shopping `not_a_check` is worse.

**Scope, stated in the product and repeated here.** Keel measures the *shape* of
verification, not its quality. A repo can be 100% anchored with terrible tests.
Anchoring says the signal comes from outside; it does not say the signal is
sufficient. Never let a high ratio be reported as "well tested".

## Development Philosophy

Four principles govern every change in this workspace — *think before coding · simplicity first · surgical changes · goal-driven execution*. They are widely-recognized engineering disciplines (sharpened by Andrej Karpathy's observations on LLM coding pitfalls); bstack's job is to make each one **machine-checkable** rather than a hopeful instruction, because a discipline that lives only as prose decays into ritual. Each principle is backed by the primitive(s) that hold it — see [AGENTS.md § Development Philosophy](AGENTS.md#development-philosophy) for the full mapping (and a note on why enforcement strength varies). Extend it with project-specific principles; the primitives stay the enforcement layer.

## Bstack Core Automation Primitives

Twenty irreducible building blocks that make this workspace self-operating. All are always active. Full specification in `AGENTS.md`.

Each primitive carries a **short name** for agent prose. When referencing a primitive in responses, PR bodies, commit messages, or comments, use the `Name (Pn)` form — *"applying Snapshot (P15)"*, *"via Dep-Chain (P14)"*, *"running Bookkeeping (P6)"* — not bare `Pn`. The number is the canonical identifier; the short name is the human-readable handle.

**Short-name index**: Bridge (P1) · Gate (P2) · Tickets (P3) · Pipeline (P4) · Fanout (P5) · Bookkeeping (P6) · Freshness (P7) · Janitor (P8) · Wait (P9) · Hygiene (P10) · Empirical (P11) · Persist (P12) · Dream (P13) · Dep-Chain (P14) · Snapshot (P15) · Crystallize (P16) · Lens (P17) · Audience (P18) · Orchestrate (P19) · Cross-Review (P20).

| # | Primitive | Mechanism | Invariant |
|---|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| P1 | **Bridge** — Conversation Bridge | Stop hook → JSONL → Obsidian docs → vault | Bridge stamp < 24h stale |
| P2 | **Gate** — Control Gate | PreToolUse hook → `.control/policy.yaml` | G1–G4 blocking, never bypassed |
| P3 | **Tickets** — Linear Tickets | Every work unit tracked Backlog → Done | No significant work without a ticket |
| P4 | **Pipeline** — PR Pipeline | Branch → PR → CI → merge → deploy | Never merge with failing checks |
| P5 | **Fanout** — Parallel Agents | Concurrent isolated agents via worktrees | No shared mutable file writes |
| P6 | **Bookkeeping** — Knowledge Bookkeeping | `bookkeeping run` → score → promote → entity pages → synthesize | `research/entities/` never contains unscored items; knowledge capture is a reflex, not a request, and **never a question** (file proactively, report after — never ask permission to document) |
| P7 | **Freshness** — Skill Freshness Check | SessionStart hook → reports stale-skill nudge if last update check ≥ 7d ago | Never blocks; closes silent-rot bug for `npx skills add` snapshots |
| P8 | **Janitor** — Branch + Worktree Janitor | `make janitor` → detects squash-merged branches + dead worktrees, removes safely | Default `--dry-run`; never touches protected branches |
| P9 | **Wait** — Productive Wait (`broomva/p9` skill) | wait-queue drains while a blocking operation runs (PR CI is the reference impl: `gh pr checks --watch` via `run_in_background` → classifier + evaluator self-heal). For non-PR waits (push-triggered deploys, builds), do a single direct check after kicking off next-priority work. | Never `sleep` on a blocking wait; merge defers to control metalayer |
| P10 | **Hygiene** — Worktree Hygiene Discipline | Reflexive rule: decide worktree-or-not before first file; keep `git status` clean; auto-run P8 janitor after every merge | A clean tree is the only reliable reset point |
| P11 | **Empirical** — Empirical Feedback Loop | Reflexive rule: validate by *interacting* — log-tails, browser E2E, screenshots, deploy verification, multi-level test composition | Reasoning isn't validation; interaction is |
| P12 | **Persist** — Persistent Loop Discipline (`broomva/persist` skill) | Reflexive rule: cross-context restart loop — state in filesystem (PROMPT.md + git tree), each iteration spawns a fresh agent context | At long-horizon work (>1h), in-context loops decay; restart fresh, backpressure from compilers/tests |
| P13 | **Dream** — Dream Cycle Discipline | Reflexive rule: any consolidation that crosses a cadence-tier boundary MUST follow the 5-phase shape (gather → replay → prune → consolidate → index) | Replay against frozen substrate is the runtime form of stop-gradient; without it, dense lower-tier signal corrupts sparse upper-tier rules |
| P14 | **Dep-Chain** — Dependency-Chain Reasoning Discipline | Reflexive rule: before any substantive write, enumerate upstream (files, functions, types, contracts, deployed state this depends on) and downstream (consumers, tests, CI gates, docs, in-flight PRs depending on this). Concrete file paths + function names in the response or PR body — not in the agent's head. | "Think deeply through chain of dependencies" without a concrete enumeration step is ritual. P14 makes it machine-checkable. |
| P15 | **Snapshot** — State-Snapshot Before Action | Reflexive rule: before any plan, the agent surfaces `git status` + branch + ahead/behind, in-flight PRs (`gh pr list`), Linear ticket state, bookkeeping/bridge freshness, last deploy state. The snapshot is *part of* the planning response — not deferred. | Plans built on stale state fail silently. P15 makes state-checking a cheap reflex, not a request the user has to make. |
| P16 | **Crystallize** — Crystallization Discipline (the Bstack Engine) | Meta-primitive — the loop that produces every other primitive. Pattern recurs ≥3 times across sessions → propose promotion to skill / SKILL.md / AGENTS.md section / `.control/policy.yaml` gate, gated by the four conditions: ≥3 instances, concrete mechanism, stated invariant, stated failure mode. | The crystallization loop must run inside the workspace, not in the user's head. P1–P15 are *outputs* of this loop. |
| P17 | **Lens** — Lens-Routed Request Articulation (`broomva/role-x` skill) | Reflexive rule: every substantive user input passes through `role/x` intake — select lens(es) from `roles/<name>.md` registry by scoring signals, load substantive context, decide mode (`augment` / `rewrite` / `decompose`); P5 fan-out becomes typed graph. | No `act as X` persona rewrites — lenses load substantive context only. Lens selection is logged. Mode decision is surfaced unless `augment`. |
| P18 | **Audience** — Format-Follows-Audience Discipline | Reflexive rule: format follows audience. Agent-readable (LLM, system-prompt loaded, in-repo reference) → **markdown**. Human-readable (decisions, review, exploration) → **HTML**. Both (README, CHANGELOG, GitHub-browseable) → markdown (GitHub renders). ASCII pseudo-diagrams + unicode-color-approximation + >100-line markdown specs without HTML companion are explicit anti-patterns. Specs/plans/ADRs land in `docs/specs/`, `docs/plans/`, `docs/adrs/` as `.html`. | Format follows audience, not habit. Markdown's expressiveness ceiling means humans bounce off agent-produced specs at ~100 lines; HTML's information density carries the load. The 2-4× HTML generation cost is paid only on artifacts a human will actually read. |
| P19 | **Orchestrate** — Orchestration-Mechanism Selection Discipline | At pre-flight of substantive autonomous work, apply the **2×2×2 mechanism cube** (session-scope × trigger-source × agent-count). **N=1 plane:** `/goal <condition>` (internal+in-session), Wait (P9) `p9 watch --background` (external+in-session), `/loop <interval>` (internal+across-session), Persist (P12) `persist iterate PROMPT.md` (external+across-session). **N>1 plane:** Fanout (P5) multi-`Agent` (external+in-session), **`bstack wave dispatch <plan...>`** (external+across-session — worktree per plan, JSONL state). Compose dynamically. | No autonomous-continuation work without explicit mechanism choice + cube-cell citation. "Continue please" / waiting for user prompts mid-arc is ritual and forbidden. |
| P20 | **Cross-Review** — Cross-Model Adversarial Review Gate (`broomva/cross-review` skill) | Before substantive PRs merge, fire cross-model adversarial gate. Three strata: A (true cross-vendor via `codex exec`), B (fresh-context subagent under devil's-advocate brief), C (composed adversarial-review skills — `superpowers:constructive-dissent`, `devils-advocate`, `pr-review-toolkit:*`, `critique`, `premortem`). Anti-slop score ≥7/10; max 3 fix rounds; verdict logged in PR comments + Linear ticket (if workspace uses Linear). Fires *before* P4 auto-merge. | Substantive PRs (>200 LOC OR public API OR multi-file OR governance-class) cannot merge without cross-model verdict ≥7/10. Self-review by the writing model as sole verdict is forbidden. |

> **Naming note.** Skill repo names are stable and don't always match primitive numbers. P6's skill repo is `broomva/bookkeeping` (named for the function). P9's skill repo is `broomva/p9` — name matches primitive number. Renaming any skill repo would break every `npx skills add` install, so when a skill repo carries a number, the primitive numbering commits to keeping it stable.

## Plugin Skill Precedence

Bstack primitives (P1–P19) and bstack-native skills (`/autonomous`, `/shape`, `/persist`, `/ship`, `/bookkeeping`, `/p9`, etc.) **supersede** plugin skills (`superpowers:*`, `pr-review-toolkit:*`, `codex:*`) wherever they conflict. Plugin skills carry no weight when they collide with workspace governance — the `superpowers:using-superpowers` skill itself encodes this priority: *"User's explicit instructions … highest priority. … If CLAUDE.md says X and a skill says Y, follow the user's instructions."*

The most common collision: plugin skills that mandate user interaction before action (notably `superpowers:brainstorming`'s discovery interview, and the meta-rule that prompts the agent to invoke a skill "even if 1% might apply"). The bstack answer is **context-first, user-extract last**:

1. Before any "interview the user" plugin skill fires, perform **Dep-Chain (P14)** + **Snapshot (P15)** over:
   - Workspace memory files (auto-memory directory)
   - `research/entities/{concept,pattern,tool,person,project}/` — knowledge graph (grep by topic before asking)
   - `docs/` (per-project) — architecture, specs, plans, conversations
   - Task-mentioned files (CV, spec, ticket body, PR diff)
2. Synthesize what's known from those sources.
3. **Ask the user only for irreducible residuals** — facts that genuinely cannot be derived from disk.
4. If steps 1–2 fully determine the task, the plugin interview is skipped; proceed to execution.

This is a precedence rule, not a new primitive — P14 + P15 already exist; this clarifies that plugin-skill rituals do not override them. The failure mode it shuts down is the "form-fill ritual" — agent asks N+ clarifying questions about facts already curated in the workspace's memory files and knowledge graph.

## Governance Stack

```
CLAUDE.md           ← Invariants (you're reading this)
AGENTS.md           ← Operational rules + primitive contract
.control/policy.yaml ← Setpoints, gates, profiles (machine-readable)
```

## Hooks (Claude Code Integration)

This workspace registers Claude Code hooks in `.claude/settings.json`:

| Event | Hook | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| `Stop` | `conversation-bridge-hook.sh` | Bridge (P1) — capture session to knowledge graph |
| `Notification` | `conversation-bridge-hook.sh` | Bridge (P1) — backup trigger for bridge |
| `PreToolUse` | `control-gate-hook.sh` | Gate (P2) — enforce safety shields |
| `SessionStart` | `skill-freshness-hook.sh` | Freshness (P7) — nudge user when skills are stale |

## Testing & Verification

```bash
bstack doctor             # Verify primitive contract compliance
bstack repair             # Fix specific gaps
bstack status --aggregate # Federation rollup across registered workspaces (≥ 0.18.0)
make control-audit        # Full metalayer compliance audit
make janitor              # Janitor (P8) dry-run
```

> **Federation (Phase 8, v0.18.0).** `bstack workspace` maintains an opt-in
> host-level registry at `~/.broomva/global/registry.yaml`. It is a substrate
> surface, not a new primitive — composes Snapshot (P15) + multi-layer
> composite-ω (v0.16.0 §19). Doctor §20 surfaces registry health.

## Conventions

- **Git**: feature branches, squash merge via PR. Never force push main.
- **Each project** in this workspace can have its own CLAUDE.md with project-specific context.

## Self-Documenting Standards

When modifying skills, architecture docs, or governance files:

1. **Threshold consistency**: A scoring cutoff, layer count, or primitive count changed in one file must be updated in ALL files that reference it. `SKILL.md` is the authoritative source; other files defer to it.
2. **Cross-reference integrity**: Adding a new entity type, status value, or pipeline stage requires updating both the schema/rubric AND the template files that use them.
3. **Primitive count**: Adding a primitive (P-N+1) requires bumping the count in this file's "Bstack Core Automation Primitives" header, adding the table row here, adding the section in `AGENTS.md`, and updating the composition-loop diagram. Run `bstack doctor` after changes to verify lockstep.
4. **Verification**: After modifying this file or any skill, run `bstack doctor` to confirm consistency.

These rules are enforced by agent reasoning + `bstack doctor`, not hooks. The agent reads them and applies them; the doctor surfaces gaps.
