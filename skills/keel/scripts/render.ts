/**
 * Keel — report renderer.
 *
 *   bun scripts/render.ts <report.json> [-o out.html] [--curve reports/curve.svg]
 *
 * One `report.json` in, one self-contained HTML file out: inline styles, inline
 * marks, zero external requests. It has to open from `file://` and survive
 * being emailed, so nothing here may reference a CDN, a webfont, or an image
 * host — the artifact's argument is that it depends on nothing, and an artifact
 * that fetches a stylesheet to make that argument has already lost it.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE IS ALLOWED TO DO. It locates, loads, and renders. It contains
 * no judgment: no map from a check name to a `GroundingClass`, no heuristic
 * that promotes a node, no default class. Every class shown here was decided
 * upstream by a probe or an agent and arrives in the report. The one number
 * this file computes is the ratio, and it computes it by calling the frozen
 * schema's `groundingRatio` over the report's own verdicts — then prints a
 * disclosure if that disagrees with the ratio the report carried, rather than
 * trusting a field the producer could have written by hand.
 *
 * THE FIVE REFUSALS, all of them load-bearing:
 *   - a ratio never renders alone (absolute anchored count, coverage by kind,
 *     and the raw counts sit beside it, always),
 *   - `not_a_check` prints beside the fraction, never inside it,
 *   - zero gathered nodes renders "nothing gathered", never 0.00,
 *   - an empty denominator renders "no denominator", never 0.00,
 *   - zero ε-audit comparisons renders "not run", never an agreement rate and
 *     never 1.00.
 * The last three matter most: a printed number reads as a measurement, and
 * none of those states measured anything.

 * Off-origin document references. This is the acceptance assertion, executed

 * URL (a gathered `raw` snippet routinely does), but the DOCUMENT must fetch
 * nothing. Matching on fetch-shaped markup rather than on the substring
 * "https://" is the difference between a real check and one that fires on the
 * data it is measuring.
 *
 * `@import` is matched as an at-RULE (`@import url(` / `@import "`), not as the
 * word: `tokens.css` explains in a comment why the system is one file and not
 * five "behind an @import entry point", and a check that fires on that sentence
 * is measuring its own prose. This renderer's entire subject is checks that
 * read something other than what they claim to read, so the distinction is not
 * a convenience.
 *
 * The embedding elements (`object`, `embed`, `iframe`, `video`, `audio`,
 * `source`, `track`) are refused on the TAG, with no URL test, because the
 * cross-review found they slipped through a guard written around `src=` and
 * `href=`: an `<object data="https://…">` or a `<video poster="…">` fetches on
 * load through an attribute neither pattern names. Enumerating their attributes
 * would just move the hole, and this artifact has no legitimate use for any of
 * them — a document whose argument is that it depends on nothing does not embed
 * a subdocument. Gathered target text cannot trip this: `esc()` turns a snippet
 * containing `<object` into `&lt;object` long before the guard runs.
 *
 * `<img>` is the one exception, and it is narrow in both directions. A
 * `src="data:…"` image is carried IN the document and fetches nothing, so
 * refusing it would enforce self-containment against something already
 * self-contained — and the error would say "off-origin" about bytes that never
 * leave the file. Every other `<img>` is refused, `src=` or not, because
 * `srcset` and a protocol-relative `//host` both fetch through spellings a
 * `https?:` test does not see.
 *
 * The exemption is written as TWO clauses because one is not enough, and the
 * cross-review demonstrated exactly why: `<img src="data:…"
 * srcset="https://…">` satisfies "the src is a data URI" while still fetching
 * through the other attribute. An exemption that inspects one attribute of a
 * tag that fetches through several is not an exemption, it is a hole. So the
 * second clause refuses ANY `<img>` carrying `srcset`, however innocent its
 * `src` looks.

either way.

exists. Without one, the report cannot say which surfaces the gatherer failed
