/**
 * keel corpus — the stepper that produces the corpus number.
 *
 * This script does NOT classify anything. It cannot: classification is agentic
 * by construction (SKILL.md §2), and a script that assigned classes would be
 * the rule table this project exists to detect. So the corpus run is a stepper
 * with the agent in the loop:
 *
 *   bun scripts/corpus.ts next
 *       clones the next unprocessed target (shallow, at its pinned revision),
 *       gathers, optionally dispatches the probe sandbox, samples nodes,
 *       writes .keel-corpus/<name>.pending.json, PRINTS the judgment payloads
 *       and STOPS.
 *
 *   ... the agent judges the printed batches and writes
 *       .keel-corpus/<name>.verdicts.json ...
 *
 *   bun scripts/corpus.ts record <name>
 *       merges probe + agent verdicts into reports/<name>.json, updates
 *       reports/corpus-summary.json, removes the clone, advances.
 *
 *   bun scripts/corpus.ts next --repeat <name>     (and: record <name> --repeat)
 *       re-judges an already-recorded target from scratch into a SIDE file and
 *       reports verdict agreement — the empirical repeatability number.
 *
 *   bun scripts/corpus.ts status
 *
 * Three properties are load-bearing and deliberate:
 *
 *   SEQUENTIAL, ORDERED, RECORDED. Targets run one at a time in corpus.json
 *   order, and the order actually run is written into the summary. The
 *   crystallization curve measures cost falling as the probe library grows;
 *   parallel runs race on the probe directory and destroy that signal.
 *
 *   RESUME. A target with an existing reports/<name>.json is skipped. A crash
 *   at target 8 must not re-judge 1–7 — that burns tokens and corrupts the
 *   ordered probe growth.
 *
 *   NO SILENT ANYTHING. The node cap is disclosed (nodesTotal vs nodesSampled),
 *   truncated payload text says so, per-target failures are recorded rather
 *   than swallowed, and a target that yielded nothing is reported as
 *   "nothing gathered" — never as a ratio. That last one is ENFORCED, not
 *   promised: a target that gathers zero nodes gets NO reports/<name>.json at
 *   all, because a Report must carry a GroundingRatio and every value it could
 *   carry there would be a claim. Resume therefore keys off the summary entry,
 *   not off the existence of a report file.
 *
 *   PARTIAL IS NOT COMPLETE. A target where the agent judged 2 of 40 sampled
 *   nodes is recorded with partial:true and judgedFraction:0.05, and a target
 *   where the agent judged NOTHING is excluded from totals.targetsMeasured,
 *   counted under totals.targetsUnjudged, and — like the nothing-gathered case —
 *   gets no report file at all. "15 of 15 targets measured" must mean fifteen
 *   measurements happened.
 *
 *   REPEATABILITY IS ABOUT JUDGMENT. Probe verdicts are deterministic — they
 *   agree with themselves by construction — so counting them in an "independent
 *   re-judgment" number inflates it toward 1.0 as the probe library grows. The
 *   headline agreement is computed over nodes BOTH runs decided agentically;
 *   probe and mixed-provenance overlaps are reported separately and labelled.
