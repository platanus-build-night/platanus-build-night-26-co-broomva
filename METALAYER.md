# keel — Control Metalayer

Behavioral governance manifest for the keel workspace. This file is scaffolded by `bstack bootstrap` and is the authoritative declaration of the workspace's control plant, controller, safety shields, and feedback loop.

## Plant

The **plant** is this workspace — the composition of repos / apps / services that bstack governs. The plant's measurable signals are declared as setpoints S1-S15 in `.control/policy.yaml` and measured by `scripts/metrics/measure-S<n>.sh` shipped by bstack (≥ v0.4.0).

| Signal | Source | Type | Primitive |
|---|---|---|---|
| Git status across repos | `make status` (workspace-defined) | measured | — |
| CI/CD check results | GitHub Actions + provider-specific | measured | P4 (Pipeline) |
| Conversation bridge health | `~/.cache/broomva-bridge-stamp` mtime | measured | P1 (Bridge) |
| Skills installed | union of `~/.agents/skills/` + `~/.claude/skills/` | measured | — (S10) |
| Governance files present | `CLAUDE.md` + `AGENTS.md` + `METALAYER.md` + `.control/policy.yaml` + `schemas/` | measured | — (S11) |
| Hooks wired | `.claude/settings.json` (Stop + PreToolUse + UserPromptSubmit) + `.git/hooks/pre-commit` | measured | P1 + P2 + P17 (S12) |
| Control gate enforcement | `.control/policy.yaml` active gates G1-G11 | measured | P2 (Gate) |
| Workspace-specific signals | (extend this table per workspace) | — | — |

## Controller

Agents operating in this workspace follow the policy in `.control/policy.yaml` (default `profile: governed`).

**Decision flow per session:**
1. Read `CLAUDE.md` + `AGENTS.md` for workspace invariants
2. Read `.control/policy.yaml` for active gates + setpoints
3. Check `docs/conversations/` for prior session context on branch/topic
4. Apply reflexive primitives (P10 Hygiene, P11 Empirical, P14 Dep-Chain, P15 Snapshot, P18 Audience, P19 Orchestrate) before substantive work
5. Execute within harness gates (G1-G4 hard gates enforced by `control-gate-hook.sh`)
6. Create PRs as checkpoints — never merge with failing CI (P4 Pipeline)

## Safety Shields

Hard gates (G1-G4+) enforced by `control-gate-hook.sh` on every Bash/Write/Edit tool call. The full list lives in `.control/policy.yaml` `gates.hard` — at minimum:

| Gate | Rule | Severity |
|---|---|---|
| G1 | No force-push to protected branches | blocking |
| G2 | No `git reset --hard` without backup branch | blocking |
| G3 | No `rm -rf` on home / root / protected paths | blocking |
| G4 | No staging `.env`, credentials, secrets | blocking |

Soft gates (G5-G10+) are advisory — agent guidance only. Extend in `.control/policy.yaml` `gates.soft` as workspace needs emerge.

## Estimator

Agent confidence is derived from:
- **Code context**: files read, git history checked
- **Conversation history**: prior sessions on same branch/topic (via P1 Bridge captures)
- **Knowledge graph**: entity pages in `research/entities/` (via P6 Bookkeeping)
- **CI signals**: test pass rate, build status (via P4 Pipeline + P9 Wait)
- **Setpoint state**: current measurements via `bstack status` (≥ v0.5.0)

## Feedback Loop

```
Session start
  → SessionStart hooks fire (autoupdate, freshness, role-x coverage)
  → Agent loads CLAUDE.md + AGENTS.md + policy.yaml
  → Check docs/conversations/ for prior context

Task execution
  → Apply reflexive primitives (P10/P11/P14/P15/P18/P19)
  → PreToolUse hook gates every Bash/Write/Edit against policy.yaml
  → P9 watcher monitors CI in background after push

Checkpoint
  → PR opens (P3 Tickets + P4 Pipeline)
  → CI runs → P20 Cross-Review if substantive
  → Auto-merge when green per policy.yaml.auto_merge

Post-merge
  → release.yml auto-tag + GH release (if VERSION changed)
  → P8 janitor cleans worktree + branch
  → Stop hook captures session to docs/conversations/ (P1 Bridge)

Observation update
  → P6 Bookkeeping scores raw extracts → promotes to research/entities/
  → Patterns recurring ≥3 times → P16 Crystallize candidate
  → Eventually: new primitive promoted to substrate (rule-of-three)
```

## RCS Hierarchy (reference)

The substrate operates under the Recursive Controlled Systems (RCS) hierarchy with measured stability margins:

| Level | System | Controller Π | Time scale |
|---|---|---|---|
| L0 | External plant (codebase, deploy targets) | per-tool gate enforcement | seconds |
| L1 | Agent internal (per-turn state) | reflexive primitives (P10-P20) | per-turn |
| L2 | Meta-control (CI/CD, EGRI) | release pipeline + PR validation | minutes-days |
| L3 | Governance (this metalayer) | CLAUDE.md + AGENTS.md + policy.yaml | days-weeks |

**L3 has the narrowest stability margin** (λ₃ ≈ 0.006 measured in the reference Broomva workspace). Governance changes must be rare and deliberate — rule-of-three promotion gate.

For the formal framework + canonical parameters, see the [RCS paper repo](https://github.com/broomva/bstack/tree/main/specs/) and `research/rcs/data/parameters.toml` if your workspace ships the RCS substrate.

## Harness Commands

```bash
bstack doctor               # Validate primitive contract + governance file presence
bstack metrics collect      # Compute every setpoint (≥ 0.4.0)
bstack status               # Render substrate health summary (≥ 0.5.0)
bstack repair               # Idempotent fix for gaps (governance files, hooks, policy blocks)
bstack upgrade              # Pull latest bstack release into this install
make janitor                # P8 — branch + worktree cleanup (if workspace defines)
```

## Schemas

The substrate ships JSON Schemas for declarative surfaces in `schemas/`:

- `policy.v1.json` — full `.control/policy.yaml` shape
- `setpoint.v1.json` — single setpoint
- `gate.v1.json` — single gate
- `primitives.v1.json` — primitive registry shape

Schemas v1 are stable from bstack v1.0.0 onwards (currently pre-1.0, additive changes only). Breaking changes ship a v2 schema + migration via `scripts/migrate.sh`.

## Customization

Workspaces extend this template by:
1. Adding workspace-specific signals to the Plant table
2. Defining additional gates in `.control/policy.yaml` `gates.hard` / `gates.soft`
3. Adding workspace-specific harness commands to the Harness Commands section
4. Documenting workspace-specific RCS instantiation in the RCS section (if applicable)

The bstack-shipped sections (Controller, Safety Shields, Estimator, Feedback Loop, Schemas) are stable and should not be modified directly — they're the substrate contract.
